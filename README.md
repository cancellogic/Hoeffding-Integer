# Integer-Hoeffding
This is Wassley Hoeffding's 1948 equation for detecting -frequently nonlinear- relationships in data or variables.  And modified to be computed with integer calculation to avoiding floating point math.  The value is not normalized (so only compare same n sample sizes) or shaped to a probability (higher values do have stronger relationships- good for detection of better models in machine learning or genetic algorithm health assessment -- but you won't know if a +81 point improvements results in a in or vastly improved model).   Coded in Rust for partially ordinal types (you may compare {"g","e","n","e","r","i","c","s"} and {3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,3.5,6.1} )
